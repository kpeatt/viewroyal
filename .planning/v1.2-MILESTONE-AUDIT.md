# Milestone v1.2: Pipeline Automation — Audit Report

**Audited:** 2026-02-20
**Status:** gaps_found
**Reason:** Phase 14 (Scheduled Automation) not started — 3/8 requirements unsatisfied

## Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Phase | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Frontmatter | REQUIREMENTS.md | Final Status |
|-------------|-------|----------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| DETECT-01 | 12 | SATISFIED | 12-01 | [x] Complete | satisfied |
| DETECT-02 | 12 | SATISFIED | 12-01 | [x] Complete | satisfied |
| DETECT-03 | 12 | SATISFIED | 12-02 | [x] Complete | satisfied |
| NOTIF-01 | 13 | SATISFIED | 13-01 | [x] Complete | satisfied |
| NOTIF-02 | 13 | SATISFIED | 13-01 | [x] Complete | satisfied |
| SCHED-01 | 14 | missing | missing | [ ] Pending | unsatisfied |
| SCHED-02 | 14 | missing | missing | [ ] Pending | unsatisfied |
| SCHED-03 | 14 | missing | missing | [ ] Pending | unsatisfied |

**Score:** 5/8 requirements satisfied

## Phase Status

| Phase | Name | Plans | Verification | Status |
|-------|------|-------|-------------|--------|
| 12 | Update Detection | 2/2 | passed (7/7) | Complete |
| 13 | Notifications | 1/1 | passed (4/4) | Complete |
| 14 | Scheduled Automation | 0/? | not started | Not started |

**Score:** 2/3 phases complete

## Cross-Phase Integration

| Requirement | Integration Path | Status |
|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| DETECT-01 | UpdateDetector.detect_document_changes() → find_meetings_needing_reingest() → ChangeReport | WIRED |
| DETECT-02 | UpdateDetector.detect_video_changes() → Vimeo video_map → ChangeReport | WIRED |
| DETECT-03 | run_update_mode() → iterates ChangeReport → _ingest_meetings(force_update=True) | WIRED |
| NOTIF-01 | run_update_mode() → send_update_notification(report, processed_count) → Moshi POST | WIRED |
| NOTIF-02 | send_update_notification() → _format_change_line() → "Jan 15 Council (minutes)" format | WIRED |

**Score:** 5/5 integration paths wired

## E2E Flow Verification

| Flow | Path | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| --check-updates (dry run) | CLI → run_update_check() → UpdateDetector → ChangeReport → stdout | COMPLETE |
| --update-mode (selective re-processing) | CLI → run_update_mode() → detect → process → embed → notify | COMPLETE |

**Score:** 2/2 flows complete

## Tech Debt

### Phase 12: Update Detection
- Unused import: `check_disk_documents` imported in `update_detector.py` but not called directly

### Phase 13: Notifications
- Test isolation gap: orchestrator `TestRunUpdateMode` tests do not mock `send_update_notification`, causing real Moshi push notifications during test runs when `MOSHI_TOKEN` is set in the environment

## Summary

Phases 12 and 13 are fully verified with all integration paths wired and E2E flows complete. Phase 14 (Scheduled Automation) has not been started — the 3 SCHED requirements are unsatisfied. The milestone cannot be completed until Phase 14 is planned and executed.
