# Feature Landscape: v1.4 Developer Documentation Portal

**Domain:** API documentation portal for civic data API consumers
**Researched:** 2026-02-23
**Mode:** Ecosystem research -- what do API consumers expect from a developer docs site?

---

## Executive Summary

Developer documentation portals for APIs follow a well-established hierarchy: (1) **auto-generated API reference** from the OpenAPI spec is table stakes -- without it, developers cannot discover endpoints, (2) **getting started guides** with working code examples are what reduce time-to-first-API-call from hours to minutes, and (3) **interactive playground/try-it** features, data model documentation, and a changelog separate good docs from forgettable ones.

The gold standard for API documentation -- Stripe, Twilio, Supabase -- shares common patterns: a three-panel layout (navigation, content, code examples), multi-language code snippets (curl, JavaScript, Python at minimum), copy-paste-ready examples with real API keys, and a clear "5-minute quickstart" flow. ViewRoyal.ai already has the hard part done: a well-structured OpenAPI 3.1 spec auto-generated by chanfana with Swagger UI. The documentation portal upgrades this from "reference-only" to a full developer experience.

Fumadocs provides first-class OpenAPI integration via `fumadocs-openapi`, which generates MDX pages from OpenAPI specs with built-in interactive playground, multi-language code examples, request/response schemas, and TypeScript type definitions. This means the API reference pages come essentially for free from the existing spec -- the real work is in the hand-written guides, data model docs, and editorial content that gives developers context the spec alone cannot provide.

The target audience is civic tech developers and data journalists who want to query council meeting data programmatically. They are likely familiar with REST APIs but may not be deeply technical. The docs should optimize for time-to-first-successful-API-call and clarity over comprehensiveness.

## Table Stakes Features

Features API consumers expect from any documentation site for a public API. Missing any of these makes the docs feel incomplete or unusable.

### TS-1: Auto-Generated API Reference from OpenAPI Spec

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **What** | Every endpoint documented with path, method, parameters, request body, response schema, status codes, and authentication requirements. Generated automatically from the existing `/api/v1/openapi.json` spec. |
| **Why expected** | This is the single most-used section of any API docs. Developers need to see exactly what fields are available, what filters exist, and what response shapes look like. Every serious API (Stripe, Twilio, Supabase, OpenAI) has this. Without it, the docs are useless. |
| **Complexity** | Low -- fumadocs-openapi generates these pages directly from the OpenAPI 3.1 spec. The spec already exists and is comprehensive (chanfana auto-generates it from Zod schemas). |
| **Dependencies** | Existing OpenAPI 3.1 spec at `/api/v1/openapi.json`. `fumadocs-openapi` package. |
| **Notes** | fumadocs-openapi supports two generation modes: (1) static MDX file generation via `generateFiles()` at build time, and (2) dynamic virtual pages via `openapiSource()` that regenerate as the spec changes. Static generation is simpler and sufficient since the spec only changes when we deploy. Group endpoints by tag (Meetings, People, Matters, Motions, Bylaws, Search, OCD, System) matching the existing OpenAPI tag structure. |

### TS-2: Getting Started / Quickstart Guide

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **What** | A single page that takes a developer from zero to a successful API call in under 5 minutes. Covers: (1) get an API key, (2) make your first request, (3) understand the response. |
| **Why expected** | Twilio pioneered the "5-minute quickstart" pattern and it is now universal. Stripe, Supabase, OpenAI -- all have a prominent "Getting Started" page as the first thing you see. Time-to-first-API-call (TTFC) is the key metric for developer onboarding. If a developer cannot make a working request within 5 minutes of arriving at the docs, they leave. |
| **Complexity** | Low -- this is editorial content, not code. |
| **Dependencies** | Self-service API key creation page already exists at `/settings/api-keys`. |
| **Notes** | Include a curl command that works immediately with a copy button. Show the full response. Then show the same request in JavaScript and Python. Link to the API key management page with clear instructions. Do NOT require account creation to read the docs -- only to get a key and make actual requests. |

### TS-3: Authentication Guide

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **What** | Dedicated page explaining how authentication works: API key via `X-API-Key` header (preferred) or `?apikey=` query parameter (convenience), how to create/manage keys, rate limit behavior (60 req/min), what 401 and 429 responses look like, and how to handle them. |
| **Why expected** | Auth is the first hurdle every developer hits. Stripe has a full "Authentication" page. OpenAI documents API key handling in detail. Developers need to understand not just "pass the key" but error handling, rate limit headers, and security best practices (never expose keys in client-side code). |
| **Complexity** | Low -- editorial content with code examples. |
| **Dependencies** | Existing auth middleware and rate limiting documentation in the OpenAPI spec. |
| **Notes** | Show error response shapes for 401 (missing/invalid key), 403 (insufficient permissions), and 429 (rate limited). Document the rate limit headers: `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `Retry-After`. Include a "Security Best Practices" section warning against embedding keys in frontend code. |

### TS-4: Code Examples in Multiple Languages

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **What** | Every guide and reference page includes working code examples in at least curl, JavaScript (fetch), and Python (requests). Examples should be copy-paste-ready and functional. |
| **Why expected** | The most-used part of any API documentation. Stripe shows examples in 8+ languages. Twilio shows examples in 6+ languages. At minimum, curl (universal), JavaScript (web developers), and Python (data scientists/civic tech) cover the target audience for a civic data API. |
| **Complexity** | Low for guides (hand-written). The auto-generated API reference from fumadocs-openapi includes multi-language code examples automatically. |
| **Dependencies** | fumadocs tab components for language switching. fumadocs-openapi for auto-generated examples. |
| **Notes** | Use fumadocs' `Tabs` component with `groupId` and `persist` so language selection persists across pages (if a developer picks Python, every page shows Python first). fumadocs-openapi automatically generates code samples in multiple languages from the OpenAPI spec, so the API reference gets this for free. Hand-written guides need manual examples. |

### TS-5: Full-Text Search Across Documentation

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **What** | A search box in the docs navigation that searches across all documentation pages (guides, API reference, data model docs). |
| **Why expected** | Every documentation site has search. Stripe, Supabase, and Twilio all have prominent search. Developers use search as primary navigation -- they type "pagination" and expect to find the pagination guide, the cursor parameter docs, and the response envelope description. |
| **Complexity** | Low -- fumadocs includes Orama search out of the box. Orama runs client-side (no external service needed) and indexes all MDX content automatically. |
| **Dependencies** | Built-in fumadocs Orama integration. |
| **Notes** | Orama is the default search engine in fumadocs and is free/self-hosted. It builds a search index at build time from all MDX content. No external service (Algolia, etc.) needed. Just enable the built-in search component. |

### TS-6: Clear Navigation Sidebar

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **What** | Left sidebar with hierarchical navigation organized by section: Getting Started, Guides, API Reference (grouped by resource), Data Model, Contributing. |
| **Why expected** | The left sidebar is the primary navigation pattern for API docs (Stripe, Twilio, Supabase, OpenAI all use it). Developers scan the sidebar to understand what's available and jump directly to what they need. |
| **Complexity** | Low -- fumadocs generates sidebar navigation from the file/folder structure automatically. |
| **Dependencies** | Well-organized content directory structure. |
| **Notes** | fumadocs generates the sidebar from the `content/docs/` directory structure. Organize content into clear top-level sections. The OpenAPI-generated pages integrate into the same sidebar tree. |

### TS-7: Responsive Design with Mobile Support

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **What** | Documentation site works on mobile devices with collapsible sidebar and readable content. |
| **Why expected** | Developers sometimes reference docs on phones/tablets while coding on desktop. Basic mobile support is table stakes. |
| **Complexity** | None -- fumadocs UI handles this out of the box with responsive design. |
| **Dependencies** | Using fumadocs UI components (not custom layout). |
| **Notes** | No work needed. fumadocs provides responsive layouts by default. |

---

## Differentiators

Features that elevate the docs from "adequate" to "impressive." Not strictly expected, but noticeably valuable.

### D-1: Interactive API Playground (Try It)

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **What** | On each API reference page, an interactive form where developers can fill in parameters and execute real API requests against the live API, seeing responses inline. |
| **Why differentiating** | Stripe and Supabase have interactive "Try It" panels. Most small API projects only have Swagger UI. Having an integrated playground within the beautiful docs UI (not a separate Swagger page) signals maturity and makes exploration frictionless. |
| **Complexity** | Low -- fumadocs-openapi includes an interactive playground out of the box. It is enabled by default and can be configured via `playground.enabled`. |
| **Dependencies** | fumadocs-openapi configured with the OpenAPI spec. CORS headers already configured on the API (allows `*` origin). |
| **Notes** | The existing Swagger UI at `/api/v1/docs` serves this purpose today. The fumadocs playground replaces it with a more polished, integrated experience. Developers will still need a valid API key to make authenticated requests through the playground. Consider pre-populating the playground with the `X-API-Key` header field. |

### D-2: Data Model Documentation with Entity Relationships

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **What** | A dedicated "Data Model" section documenting the key entities (Meeting, Person, Matter, Motion, Bylaw, Organization), their fields, relationships, and how they connect. Includes a visual entity relationship diagram. |
| **Why differentiating** | Most API docs only document individual endpoints. Documenting the data model separately helps developers understand the domain -- how meetings contain agenda items, how motions link to matters, how people have memberships in organizations. This conceptual understanding helps them use the API effectively rather than guessing which endpoints to combine. |
| **Complexity** | Medium -- requires hand-written content explaining the civic data domain and a Mermaid ER diagram. |
| **Dependencies** | Knowledge of the database schema and entity relationships. |
| **Notes** | Use Mermaid diagrams (fumadocs supports Mermaid via rehype plugins or embedded in MDX). Document the key relationships: Meeting has many AgendaItems, AgendaItem has many Motions, Motion has Votes, Matter tracks across Meetings, Person has Memberships in Organizations. Explain civic-specific concepts (what is a "matter" vs a "motion" vs a "bylaw") for developers unfamiliar with municipal governance. |

### D-3: Pagination and Filtering Guide

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **What** | A guide explaining the two pagination systems (cursor-based for v1 API, page-based for OCD API), how to traverse all results, and how to use available filters effectively. |
| **Why differentiating** | Pagination is consistently the most-asked-about topic for API consumers. A dedicated guide with working examples showing "how to fetch all meetings from 2024" or "how to paginate through all motions" saves developers from piecing together pagination behavior from individual endpoint docs. |
| **Complexity** | Low -- editorial content with code examples. |
| **Dependencies** | Understanding of cursor-based pagination (opaque base64 cursors) and OCD page-based pagination. |
| **Notes** | Include complete working examples that loop through all pages. Document the cursor format expectations (opaque, do not parse). Explain the difference between v1 API cursor pagination and OCD API page pagination. |

### D-4: Changelog

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **What** | A page documenting API changes over time: new endpoints, new fields, deprecated features, breaking changes. |
| **Why differentiating** | Stripe, OpenAI, and Twilio all maintain detailed changelogs. A changelog signals that the API is actively maintained and gives consumers confidence they will be informed about changes. For a v1 API, the initial changelog is simple, but establishing the pattern early is valuable. |
| **Complexity** | Low -- a single MDX page with dated entries. |
| **Dependencies** | None. |
| **Notes** | Start with a single entry for the v1.0 API launch. Use semantic versioning. Include the date, what changed, and whether the change is additive (non-breaking) or breaking. Fumadocs supports this as a regular MDX page -- no special tooling needed. |

### D-5: Rate Limiting and Error Handling Guide

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **What** | Dedicated guide covering: all error codes and their meanings, how to parse the error response envelope, rate limit headers and how to implement exponential backoff, and common mistakes (wrong auth header, missing municipality slug). |
| **Why differentiating** | Twilio is famous for its error code index. Most small APIs leave error handling as an afterthought. A dedicated error guide prevents support burden and helps developers build resilient integrations. |
| **Complexity** | Low -- editorial content with code examples. |
| **Dependencies** | Existing error response format (`{ error: { code, message, status } }`). |
| **Notes** | Document every error code: `NOT_FOUND`, `UNAUTHORIZED`, `RATE_LIMITED`, `BAD_REQUEST`, `INTERNAL_ERROR`, `MUNICIPALITY_NOT_FOUND`. Include retry logic examples in curl/JS/Python. |

### D-6: Contribution Guide

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **What** | A page explaining how to report bugs, request features, and contribute to the project. Links to GitHub issues, explains the monorepo structure at a high level, and invites civic tech contributors. |
| **Why differentiating** | For an open civic tech project, welcoming contributors builds community. Most API docs skip this. Including it signals openness and invites the civic tech community to engage. |
| **Complexity** | Low -- editorial content. |
| **Dependencies** | None. |
| **Notes** | Keep it simple: link to GitHub, explain how to file issues, mention the OCD standard compliance. Do NOT turn this into a full developer setup guide for the codebase -- that is a different audience. |

### D-7: OCD Standard Reference

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **What** | A guide explaining the Open Civic Data standard, how ViewRoyal.ai's OCD endpoints work, how OCD IDs are formatted, and how to use these endpoints with other civic tech tools (e.g., OpenStates-compatible consumers). |
| **Why differentiating** | OCD endpoints are a unique feature. Civic tech developers who know OCD will want to understand how this implementation maps to the standard. Those who do not know OCD will want to understand why separate endpoints exist and whether they should use v1 or OCD. |
| **Complexity** | Low -- editorial content with entity mapping table. |
| **Dependencies** | Existing OCD endpoints and OCD ID generation logic. |
| **Notes** | Include a comparison table: "When to use v1 API vs OCD API." Explain the entity mapping (Matter = Bill, Meeting = Event, Motion = Vote). Link to the official OCD spec. |

## Anti-Features (Deliberately NOT Building)

### AF-1: Auto-Generated Client SDKs in the Docs
**Why not:** SDK generation from OpenAPI specs is trivial for developers to do themselves using `openapi-generator`, `orval`, or `openapi-typescript`. Shipping and maintaining SDKs in the docs creates an ongoing maintenance burden. Instead, document how developers can generate their own typed clients from the OpenAPI spec. A one-paragraph "Generating a Client" section with the command is sufficient.

### AF-2: Versioned Documentation (Multiple API Versions)
**Why not:** There is only one API version (v1). Building version switching UI, maintaining multiple doc versions, and managing version routing adds complexity with zero current benefit. When v2 ships someday, add versioning then. For now, the docs document v1.

### AF-3: User Accounts / Personalized Docs
**Why not:** Stripe auto-populates docs with your test API key when logged in. This is a great feature for Stripe's scale but requires auth integration between the docs site and the main app, which adds significant complexity. The docs site should be statically generated and publicly readable without any login. Users get their API key from the main app at `/settings/api-keys`.

### AF-4: Community Features (Comments, Discussions, Voting)
**Why not:** Inline documentation comments (like ReadMe.io or some API portals) create moderation burden and can contain outdated or misleading information. GitHub Issues and Discussions are the appropriate channels for community interaction. Link to them from the docs.

### AF-5: AI-Powered Doc Search / Chatbot
**Why not:** The main app already has RAG-powered search for council data. Adding a separate AI search just for the documentation adds infrastructure complexity. Orama's text search is sufficient for a docs site of this size (likely <100 pages). If the docs grow significantly, revisit this.

### AF-6: Hosted Postman Collections / Run in Postman Button
**Why not:** Postman collections are another artifact to maintain. The OpenAPI spec IS the collection -- developers can import it directly into Postman, Insomnia, or any API client. Document this in a one-liner rather than maintaining a separate Postman workspace.

### AF-7: Multi-Language Docs (i18n)
**Why not:** The API serves Canadian municipal data in English. The target audience reads English. Internationalization of the docs is unnecessary effort with no current demand.

### AF-8: Blog / Tutorials Section
**Why not:** A blog requires ongoing content creation and maintenance. The docs should be reference-oriented with guides. If there is a future need for tutorials or announcements, that belongs on the main ViewRoyal.ai site, not the developer docs.

## Best-in-Class Patterns to Emulate

Patterns observed in Stripe, Twilio, Supabase, and OpenAI documentation that apply to this project:

### Pattern 1: Three-Panel Layout
Stripe and Supabase use: left sidebar (navigation), center (content/prose), right (code examples). Fumadocs supports this layout natively. The API reference pages from fumadocs-openapi render in this style automatically.

### Pattern 2: Persistent Language Selection
When a developer selects "Python" on one page, every other page shows Python examples first. Fumadocs `Tabs` component supports this via `groupId` with `persist` (localStorage). Apply this to all hand-written guide pages.

### Pattern 3: Copy Button on All Code Blocks
Every code example should have a one-click copy button. Fumadocs includes copy buttons on code blocks by default.

### Pattern 4: Deep Linking to Sections
Every heading should generate an anchor link so developers can share URLs to specific sections. Fumadocs generates heading anchors automatically from MDX headings.

### Pattern 5: "On This Page" Table of Contents
A right-side TOC showing all headings on the current page, highlighting the active section as you scroll. Fumadocs includes this as a built-in UI component.

## Content Inventory (Estimated Pages)

| Section | Pages | Type | Effort |
|---------|-------|------|--------|
| Getting Started | 1 | Hand-written | Low |
| Authentication | 1 | Hand-written | Low |
| Pagination & Filtering | 1 | Hand-written | Low |
| Error Handling | 1 | Hand-written | Low |
| Data Model | 1-2 | Hand-written + Mermaid diagram | Medium |
| OCD Standard | 1 | Hand-written | Low |
| API Reference (v1) | ~13 | Auto-generated from OpenAPI spec | Low (generated) |
| API Reference (OCD) | ~12 | Auto-generated from OpenAPI spec | Low (generated) |
| Changelog | 1 | Hand-written | Low |
| Contribution Guide | 1 | Hand-written | Low |
| **Total** | **~33-34** | Mix of generated and hand-written | **Low-Medium overall** |

The bulk of the pages (~25) are auto-generated from the OpenAPI spec. Only ~8-9 pages need to be hand-written, and those are primarily editorial content with code examples.
