## Overview

ViewRoyal.ai is an open civic intelligence platform for the Town of View Royal, British Columbia. It transforms public council meeting records into structured, searchable data. Contributions and feedback are welcome via GitHub.

## Reporting Bugs

Found an issue with the API? [Open a bug report](https://github.com/kpeatt/viewroyal/issues/new) on GitHub.

Please include:

- **Endpoint URL** you were calling (e.g., `/api/v1/view-royal/meetings`)
- **Request parameters** (query string, headers used)
- **Expected response** vs **actual response**
- **API key prefix** (first 8 characters only -- never share the full key)

## Requesting Features

Have an idea for the API? [Open a feature request](https://github.com/kpeatt/viewroyal/issues/new) on GitHub.

Please describe:

- **Use case** -- what are you building and how would this help?
- **Which endpoints or entities** are involved
- **Any standards or formats** to consider (e.g., OCD, GeoJSON)

## API Feedback

We welcome feedback on:

- **Response shapes** -- are fields named clearly? Is anything confusing?
- **Missing fields** -- is there data you expected but could not find?
- **Documentation clarity** -- is anything unclear or incomplete?

Use the same [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/kpeatt/viewroyal/issues) page for feedback.

## Important Notes

<Callout>
  - The API is **read-only** -- there are no write endpoints. All data comes from public council meeting records.
  - The **OCD endpoints** follow the [Open Civic Data specification](https://opencivicdata.readthedocs.io/) and are publicly accessible without authentication.
  - Data is sourced from the Town of View Royal's public meeting documents and video recordings.
